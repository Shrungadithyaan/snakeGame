# Snake Game

This is a classic Snake Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is played by controlling a snake, which moves around on a game board to eat food items and grow longer. The goal is to keep the snake alive as long as possible by avoiding the walls and the snake's own tail, which grows longer with each piece of food that is eaten.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the direction of the snake.
- Eat the food items to grow longer.
- Avoid the walls and the snake's own tail.
- The game is over when the snake collides with a wall or its own tail.
